BARBARA
They ought to make the day the time changes the first day of summer. Then two good things would happen all at once.

BARBARA
I love the long days and the extra sun.

JOHN
A lot of good the extra daylight does me. i lost an hour’s sleep. And it’s dark already, and we still have a three-hour drive, and we won’t get back till after midnight.

BARBARA
If it really dragged you that much, you wouldn’t do it.

JOHN
Are you kidding?  I certainly don’t want to blow sunday on this scene. We’re gonna either have to move mother to Parkville or move the grave to pittsburgh.

BARBARA
Oh, you’re just being silly. Mother can’t make a drive like this.

JOHN
Look, twenty-five dollars ... “We Still Remember”... I don’t, you know it ... I don’t remember what the guy looks like.

BARBARA
Johnny ... it takes you five minutes.

JOHN
Three hours... no, six hours ... six hours and five minutes.

JOHN
Mother wants to remember. So we have to drive four-hundred miles to plant a cross on a grave, as if he’s staring up through the ground
to check out the decorations ... (he points at the cross inscription)
... we have to remember ... and she stays at home.

BARBARA
Johnny, we’re here ... all right?

JOHN
Hey ... hey, Barb, you know the radio’s been on all this time ...
