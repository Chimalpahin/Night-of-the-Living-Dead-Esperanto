### BARBARA

00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,815

They ought to make the day the time changes the first day of summer.

La unua tago de la somero devas esti la komenco de somera tempo. 

NOTE: According to ESPDIC, "somera tempo : daylight saving time, summer time", so this line sounds kind of weird.


### JOHN

00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,155

What?

Kio?


### BARBARA

00:02:19,323 --> 00:02:21,416

Well, it's eight o'clock and it's still light.

Nu, estas oka horo kaj estas ankoraŭ luma.


### JOHN

00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,262

A lot of good the extra daylight does us.

Ekstraj sunlumoj estas sentaŭga, laŭ mi.


### JOHN

00:02:24,304 --> 00:02:26,020

Now we've still got a three-hour drive back.

ni bezonas veturi tri horojn plu 


### JOHN

00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,030

We're not going to be home until after midnight.

Ni ne revenos ĝis post meznokto.


### BARBARA

00:02:28,071 --> 00:02:30,792

Well, if it really bugged you, Johnny, you wouldn't do it.

Se ĝi fakte ĝenas vin tiel, vi ne farus tion.


### JOHN

00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:33,681

You think I wanna blow Sunday on a scene like this?

Fakte, mi ne volas malŝpari dimanĉon tie ĉi. 


### JOHN

00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:35,858

You know, I figure we're either gonna have to move mother out here,

Ni devas aŭ transloĝigi panjon al tie ĉi,


### JOHN

00:02:35,983 --> 00:02:38,495

or move the grave into Pittsburgh.

aŭ translokigi la tombon al Picburgo.


### BARBARA

00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:40,588

She can't make a trip like this.
 
Panjo ne povas veturi longe.
 

### JOHN
00:02:40,672 --> 00:02:42,848

I don't know that she can't.

Mi dubas pri tio.


### JOHN
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:46,909

Is there any candy left?

Ĉu ni havas plu dolĉajojn?


### BARBARA

00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:46,909

No.

Ne.


### JOHN

00:02:47,285 --> 00:02:49,671

Look at this thing. "We still remember."

Rigardu tiun ĉi. "Ni ankoraŭ memoras."


### JOHN

00:02:49,797 --> 00:02:52,267

I don't. You know, I don't even remember what the man looks like.

Ne mi. Fakte, mi eĉ ne memoras kiel li aspektis.


### BARBARA

00:02:52,392 --> 00:02:54,067

Johnny, it takes you five minutes.

Joĉjo, ???


### JOHN
00:02:54,192 --> 00:02:59,173

5 minutes to put the wreath on the grave and 6 hours to drive back and forth.

Kvin minutoj por meti la garlandon sur la tombo, kaj ses horoj por veturi hejmen.


### JOHN

00:02:59,215 --> 00:03:01,476

Mother wants to remember, so we trot 200 miles into the count

Patrino volas memori, do ni kunveturi 200 mejlojn


### JOHN

00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:03,569

and she stays at home.

kaj ŝi restis hejme.


### BARBARA

00:03:03,736 --> 00:03:05,536

Well, we're here, John, all right?

Ni ĉeestas, Johano. Bone?


## RADIO

00:03:12,945 --> 00:03:15,750

Testing... back on... Ah, ladies and... We're coming back

Provo... ŝaltas... Ho, sinjorinoj kaj... Ni rekomencas -


### JOHN

00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:16,000

Hey-

Hej --


## RADIO 

00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:18,262

on the air after an interruption due to technical problem...

- elsendi, post interrompiĝo, pro teknika problemo...


### JOHN

00:03:30,694 --> 00:03:33,792

There's nothing wrong with the radio. Must've been the station.

La radio funkcias bone. Eble la radiostacio fuŝis ion.


### BARBARA

00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:36,136

Which row is it in?

En kiu vico ĝi estas?


### JOHN

00:03:56,438 --> 00:03:58,447

There's no one around.

Neniu ĉeestas.


### BARBARA

00:03:58,698 --> 00:04:01,335

Well, it's late. If you'd gotten up earlier...

Nu, estas malfrua. Se vi vekiĝis pli frue...


### JOHN

00:04:01,377 --> 00:04:04,265

Oh, look, I already lost an hour's sleep in the time change.

Nu, mi jam perdis unu horon de dormado pro la tempoŝanĝo.


### BARBARA

00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:07,405

I think you complain just to hear yourself talk.

Vi plendas do vi povas aŭskulti vin mem.


### BARBARA

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,122

There it is.

Jen, tie.


### JOHN

00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:27,707

I wonder what happened to the one from last year.

Kio okazis al la pasintjara garlando?


### JOHN
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:31,097

Each year we spend good money on these things.

Ĉiujare ni aĉetas multekostan garlandon.


### JOHN

00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:33,777

We come out here, and the one from last year is gone.

Ni veturas al ĉi tie, kaj la malnova iu malaperis.


### BARBARA

00:04:33,861 --> 00:04:35,744

Well, the flowers die,

Nu, floroj mortas,


### BARBARA

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,549

And the caretaker or somebody takes them away.

Kaj la gardisto, aŭ iu, forprenas ĝin.


### JOHN

00:04:39,051 --> 00:04:42,106

Yeah, a little spit and polish,

Nu, per iom da kraĉo kaj ciro,


### JOHN

00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,404

he can clean this up sell it next year.

li povas purigi ĝin kaj revendi venontjare.


### JOHN

00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:46,711

Wonder how many times we bought the same one?

Kiom da okazo ni aĉetis la saman garlandon?


### JOHN

00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:06,804

Hey, come on, Barb, church was this morning, huh?

Ho, ve, Barnjo. Diservo estis matene, ĉu ne?


### JOHN

00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:30,078

Hey, I mean, praying's for church, huh? Come on.

Mi intencis, preĝado estas por la preĝejo. Venu.


### BARBARA

00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:33,134

I haven't seen you in church lately.

Mi ne vidas vin en la preĝejo nuntempe.


### JOHN

00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:37,278

Well, there's not much sense in my going to church.

Nu, mi ne havas kialon por iri al la preĝejo.


### JOHN

00:05:37,989 --> 00:05:41,548

Do you remember one time when we were small, we were out here?

Ĉu vi memoras, kiam ni estis infanoj, kaj venis tie ĉi?


### JOHN

00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:43,557

It was from right over there.

Ni estis tie.


### JOHN

00:05:43,682 --> 00:05:45,566

I jumped out at you from behind the tree

Mi elsaltis el malantaŭ la arbo


### JOHN

00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,329

And grandpa got all excited, and he shook his fist at me, and he said,

Avaĉjo agitiĝis, kaj skuiĝis lian pugnon al mi, kaj diris,


### JOHN

00:05:48,413 --> 00:05:50,715

"Boy, you'll be damned to hell."

"Knabo, vi estos damnata inferen."


### JOHN

00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:53,561

Remember that? Right over there.

Ĉu vi memoras? Jen, tie.


### JOHN

00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,403

Well, you used to really be scared here.

Vi estis tre tima ĉi tie.


### BARBARA

00:05:57,036 --> 00:05:58,376

Johnny.

Joĉĵo.


### JOHN
00:05:58,794 --> 00:06:02,268

Well, you're still afraid.

Nu, vi ankoraŭ timas.


### BARBARA
00:05:58,794 --> 00:06:02,268

Stop it now. I mean it.

Haltu tuj. Serioze.


### JOHN

00:06:05,952 --> 00:06:09,217

They're coming to get you, Barbara.

Ili venos por kapti vin, Barbara.


### BARBARA

00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,154

Stop it. You're ignorant.

Haltu. Vi estas stulta.


### JOHN

00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:14,450

They're coming for you, Barbara.

Ili ĉaskuros vin, Barbara.



### BARBARA

00:06:15,203 --> 00:06:17,505

Stop it. You're acting like a child.

Silentu. Vi agas kiel infano.



### JOHN

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,389

They're coming for you.

Ili ĉaskuros vin.


### JOHN

00:06:19,975 --> 00:06:22,696

Look! There comes one of them now.

Atentu! Oni venas nun.


### BARBARA

00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:26,379

He'll hear you.

Li aŭdos vin.


### JOHN

00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:26,379

Here he comes. I getting out of here.

Li venas. Mi foriras tuj!


### BARBARA

00:06:26,547 --> 00:06:27,636

Johnny!

Joĉjo!


### BARBARA

00:06:38,436 --> 00:06:39,607

Johnny!

Joĉjo!


### BARBARA

00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,449

Help me!

(His face grows more intense with the memory)

and I get a  good look at ‘em ... I see them for the first time in my lights ... and then ...

RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Up to the minute reports inform us  that the ... siege ... first
documented in the midwestern  section of the country is indeed spread across the nation, and is in fact world-wide. Medical and
scientific advisors have been  summoned to the white house, and reporters on the scene in Washington inform us that the 8President is planning to make
public the results of that  conference in an address to the nation over your civil defense emergency network.

RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
The ... . strange  ... . beings, that have appeared in most parts of the nation, seem to have certain predictable patterns of behavior.
in the few hours  following initial reports of violence and death ... and apparently deranged attacks on the lives of people taken completely
off guard, it has been established  that the ...
alien beings are  human in many physical and behavioral aspects. Hypotheses as to their origin and their aims have to this point been so varied and so diverse that we must only
report these factors to be  unknown. teams of scientist and physicians presently have the corpses of several of the ...

RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
aggressors, and these corpses are  being studied for clues that might negate or confirm existing theories. the most ... overwhelming fact ... is that these ...
beings are infiltrating  through urban and rural areas throughout the nation, in forces of varying number, and if they have not as yet evidenced  themselves in your area, please ...
take every available  precaution. Attack may come at any time, in any place, without warning. Repeating the important facts from our previous reports. There is an ...
aggressive  force ... army ... of unexplained, unidentified ... humanoid beings ... . that has  appeared ... . In world-wide proportions ... . and these beings are totally aggressive ...
irrational in their violence ... .  civil defense efforts are underway ... and investigations as to the origin and purpose of the aggressors are being conducted.

All citizens are urged to take utmost precautionary measures to defend against the ... ..insidious ... alien ... force ... these beings are weak in physical strength ... are easily distinguishable from humans
by their deformed appearance ...  They are usually unarmed but appear capable of handling weapons ... They have appeared, not led and organized army, not with any apparent reason or plan ...
indeed, they seem to be  driven with the urges of entranced ... or ... . or obsessed minds. they appear totally unthinking ...
they can..  I repeat: they can be stopped by immobilization: that is, by blinding or dismembering.  they are, on the average, weaker in strength than an adult human, but their strength is in numbers, in
surprise, and in the sheer fact that they are beyond our normal realm of understanding. They appear to be irrational, non-communicative beings ... and they are definitely to be considered our enemies in what we must call a 

TOM 
It’s all right ... we’re from the gas station ... we’re not ...

HARRY
Listen.

RADIO VOICE:
... periodic reports, as  information reaches this newsroom, as well as survival information and a listing of red cross rescue points, where pick-ups will be made as often as possible with the equipment and staff presently available ... 

TRUCKDRIVER
..Why ... Man, I ...

TOM
Looks like you got things pretty well locked in.

TRUCKDRIVER
Man, I could’ve used some help.  How long you guys been in there?

HARRY
That’s the cellar ... . It’s the safest place.

TRUCKDRIVER
Man, you mean you didn’t hear the racket we was makin’ up here?

HARRY
How were we supposed to know what was going on up here? It could have been those things, for all we know.

TRUCKDRIVER
That girl was screamin’.  Now, you know what a girl sounds like. Them things don’t make no noise. Anybody’s got to know there’s somebody up here could use some help.

TOM
You can’t really tell what’s goin’
on from down there ...

HARRY
We thought we could hear screams, but that might have meant ... Those things were in the house after her.

TRUCKDRIVER
And you wouldn’t come up ‘n help?

TOM
... Well, I.. if ... there was more of us ...

HARRY
That racket sounded like the place  was being ripped apart ... How were we supposed ...

TRUCKDRIVER
You just said it was hard to hear down there. Now you say it sounded like the place was being ripped apart. You better get your story straight, mister ... ...

HARRY
All right! Now you tell me. I’m  not going to take those kind of chances when we got a safe place ... We luck into a safe place, and you’re tellin’ us to risk our lives just because somebody needs help ... .

TRUCKDRIVER
Somethin’ like that, yeah.

TOM
All right ...  why don’t we settle ... . 

HARRY
Look, mister ...

all right ...  we came up, okay? We’re here. Now I suggest we all go back downstairs before any of these things find out we’re in here.

TRUCKDRIVER
They can’t get in here.

TOM
You got the whole place boarded up?

TRUCKDRIVER
Most of it.  all but upstairs ...  It’s weak in places, but it won’t be hard to fix it up good ...

HARRY
You’re insane. The cellars the safest place in the house.

TRUCKDRIVER
I’m tellin’ you  they can’t get in here!

HARRY
And I’m tellin you ...  those things turned over our car. We were damned lucky to get away at all. Now you tell me they can’t get through a pile of wood.

TOM
His wife and kid’s downstairs. The kid’s pretty badly tore up. 

TRUCKDRIVER:
Well, I ...  I think we’re better off up here.

TOM:
We could strengthen all these up, Mr. Tinsdale.

TRUCKDRIVER:
Man, with all us workin’ we could  fix this up so nothin’ can get in here ... and we got food ... the fire ... and we got the radio.

HARRY:
We can bring all those things downstairs with us. Man, you’re crazy you got a million windows up here ...
All these windows,  you’re gonna make strong enough to keep them out?

TRUCKDRIVER:
Them things ain’t got no strength, man, I smashed three of ‘em pushed another one out the door.

HARRY
I’m telling you they turned our car onto it’s roof.

TRUCKDRIVER
Oh, hell, any good five men can do that. 

HARRY
That’s my point! ... only there’s not going to be five ... . there’s not going to be ten ... twenty ...
thirty ...  a hundred. Maybe ... you know? Once they know we’re in here, the place’ll be crawlin’ with ‘em.

TRUCKDRIVER
Well, if there’s that many, there gonna get us wherever we’re at.

HARRY
Look, in the cellar, there’s only  one door, all right? Only one. that’s the only place we have to protect.
And Tom and I fixed it  so it locks and boards from the inside. but all these doors and windows ... . Why, we’d never know where they were going to hit us next.

TRUCKDRIVER
You got a point, Mr. Tinsdale, but  down in the cellar there’s no place to run ... I mean, if they do get in, there’s no back exit. We’d be done for. 

TOM
We could get out of here if we had  to ... and we can see what’s goin’ on outside ... Down there, there ain’t any windows.. If a rescue party does come we’d never know it ... windows ...

HARRY
But the cellar is the strongest place!

TRUCKDRIVER
The upstairs is just as much of a trap as the cellar ... There’s three rooms up there, and they have to be boarded up like this stuff down here ...
Then if they  do get in the windows they can’t get past the doors ... and they’re weak, we can keep them out. I got this gun now, and I
didn’t have it before, and I still beat three of them off ...  now, we might have to try and get out of here ourselves, ‘cause there ain’t no guarantee that anybody is gonna send help ...
Suppose them  things come in here ... We can’t bust outta the cellar, cause we open that one door and they got us ...

TOM
I don’t know. I think he’s right. 

You know how many’s out there?

TRUCKDRIVER
I figure maybe six, seven.

HARRY
Look, you two can do whatever you like. I’m going back down to the cellar, and you better decide, because I’m gonna board up that
door and I’m not gonna be crazy  enough to unlock it again, no matter what happens. 

TOM
Wait a minute, Mr. Tinsdale, let’s think about this for awhile ... 

HARRY 
Nope.  I’ve made my decision. You make yours. And you can stew in your own juice.

TOM
Now wait a minute dammit let’s think about this awhile ... We can make it into the cellar if we have to ...
and if we do decide  to stay down there, we will need some things from up here ... Now  let’s at least consider this awhile ...

TRUCKDRIVER
Man, if you box yourself into that cellar, and if there is a lot of them things that get into the house, you had it.
At least up here you can outrun the things. Tom is gone to one of the windows and is peering out through an opening in the barricade. 

TOM
Yeah, looks like six ... or about ... eight ...

TRUCKDRIVER
That’s more than there was ...  there’s a bunch out the back, too ...
... unless they’re the same ones that was back here.

HELEN
Harry ... . Harry ... .  Harry ... . Are you all right?

HARRY
it’s all right, Helen ... we’re all right ...

TOM
Oh ... Good God!

TOM
Mother Of God ...  What are these things?

TRUCKDRIVER
Damn ... damn thing from hell ...

HELEN
Harry ... . Harry! ... 

TRUCKDRIVER
We gotta fix these boards.

HARRY
You’re crazy ...  those things are gonna be at every door and window in the place. We’ve got to get into the cellar.

TRUCKDRIVER
Go ahead into your damn cellar! Get outta here!

HARRY
I’m taking the girl with me.

TRUCKDRIVER
You keep your hands off of her, she’s stayin’ here with me.

TRUCKDRIVER (CONT'D)
And you don’t touch none of that food.

Now if I stay up here I’m gonna be  fightin’ for what’s up here ... And that food and that radio and  all this is what I’m fightin’ for.
And you are stone dead wrong ... you’re just wrong, you understand ... Now, if you’re makin’ it to the cellar get your ass movin’ ...
go down these  stairs ... . and get out of here, man ... and ... and ... don’t mess with me no more ... .

HARRY
The man is crazy ... he’s crazy ... We’ve got to have food down there ... we have a right ...

TRUCKDRIVER
This is your house?

HARRY
We’ve go a right to..

TRUCKDRIVER
You goin’ down there with him?

TOM
... Well ...

TRUCKDRIVER
No beatin’ around the bush ... you goin’ or ain’t you?  This is your last chance

TOM
Harry ... . I think he’s right.

HARRY
You’re crazy.

TOM
I really think we’re better off up here.

HARRY
You’re crazy. I got a kid down there. He can’t take all the racket, and those things reaching through the glass. We’ll be lucky if he lives as it is now.

TRUCKDRIVER
Okay. Now you’re his father.  If you’re dumb enough to go die in that trap, it’s your business. 
But I ain’t dumb enough to go with  you. it’s just bad luck for the kid that his old man’s so dumb ... .
Now get the hell down  the cellar ... you can be boss down there ... and I’m boss up here ... and you ain’t takin’ none of this food, and you ain’t takin’ nothin’.

TOM
Harry ... we can get food to you ... if you want to stay down there ... and ...

HARRY
You bastards!

HELEN
Harry ...  Harry! 

HARRY
You know I won’t open the door again. I mean it.

TOM
We can fix this up here. With your help, we could ...

HARRY
Yeah ... .
well I think you’re both nuts ... with my help!

TRUCKDRIVER
Let him go, man, his mind is made up, now let him go. 

TOM
Harry, we’d be better off up here!  

TOM
Harry, if we stick together, man,  we can fix it up real good ... There are places we can run to up here ...

TOM
Harry ...
we’d be better off if  all three of us was workin’ together ... 

TOM
We’ll let you have food when you need it ...
... and if we knock those things  might be chasin’ us and you can let us in ...

TRUCKDRIVER
Hey ... hey, honey.

TRUCKDRIVER
He’s wrong, man.

TRUCKDRIVER
I ain’t boxin’ myself in down  there no how.
We might be here several days ... we’ll get it fixed up ... he’ll come up ... He ain’t gonna stay down there very long ... he’ll wanta see what’s goin’ on ...
or  maybe if we get a chance to get out ... he’ll come up. He turns and goes up the stairs ... 

(page 58)

HELEN
He has a bad fever.

HARRY
There’s two more people upstairs.

HELEN
Two?

HARRY
Yeah ...
(a long pause, then half-
defensively)
I wasn’t about to take any unnecessary chances.

HARRY
How did we know what was going on up there?

HARRY
Does he seem to be all right?

HARRY
They’re all staying upstairs ... .  Idiots! We should stick together ... it’s safest down here ... ..

HARRY
They don’t stand a chance up  there ... . they can’t hold those things off forever ... There’s too many ways they can get into the house up there ...

HARRY
They had a radio on upstairs ...  must’ve been civil defense or ... I think it’s not just us, this thing is happening all over.

HARRY
This damned thing ... 

HELEN
Harry ...

HELEN
Harry ... that thing can’t pick  up anything in this stinking dungeon!

HARRY
I hate you ... right? I hate the kid? I wanna see you die here, right? 
In this stinking place. my god, Helen, do you realize what’s happening? Those things are all over the place ...
they’ll kill  us all ... I enjoy watching my kid suffer like this? I enjoy seeing all this happen?

HELEN
He needs help ...  he needs a doctor ... he’s ... he’s ... gonna maybe die here ... We have to get out of here, Harry. we have to.

HARRY
Oh, yeah ...  let’s just walk out. We can pack up right now and get ready to go, and i’ll just say to those things, `Excuse me.. my wife and kid are uncomfortable here ... we’re going into town.’
For god’s sake ...  there’s maybe twenty of those things out there. and there’s more every minute ... . 

HELEN 
There’s people upstairs. We should stick together you said. Are we fighting with them? Upstairs, downstairs ...
what’s  the difference? Maybe they can help us. Let’s get out of here ... . let’s go upstairs ... let’s do something ... . let’s get out of here ...

TOM
HARRY!

HELEN
Yes ... yes, Tom!

HELEN
Harry ...  Harry ... it’s Tom Ryan. 

TOM 
Harry ... we got food, and some medicine and things from up here ...

TOM
There’s gonna be a thing on the radio ...  in ten minutes, Harry ... a civil defense thing ... . to tell us what to do.

HELEN
WE’RE COMING UP! WE’LL BE UP IN A MINUTE! 

HARRY 
You’re out of your mind, Helen. All it takes is a minute ... those things get in up there and it’s too late to change your mind ...
Don’t you see that?  Can’t you see that we’re safe as long as we keep that door sealed up?

HELEN
I don’t give a damn! I don’t care, Harry ... I don’t care anymore... I want to get out of here ... go upstairs ... see if someone will help us ... maybe Karen will be okay ... 

HELEN
Harry ... please ...  for just a minute ... . we’ll go up and see what’s up there ... We’ll hear the radio, and maybe we can figure some way to get out of here ... maybe with all of us we can make it, Harry

TOM
Harry! ... . Hey, Harry! ...  Ben found a television upstairs! Come on up ... we’ll see the civil defense broadcast on tv ...

HELEN
Come on ... let’s go up ... there’ll be something on tv that tells us what to do. you can tell them I wanted to come up ... . 

HARRY
All right ... this is your decision ... we’ll go up ... but don’t blame me if we all get killed ...

TOM
We can see the broadcast, I think ... if the tv works. I have to go help ben.

HELEN
Poor thing ...  she must have been through a lot.

TOM
I think her brother was killed out there.

BEN
Tom ... hey, Tom! Are you gonna give me a hand with this thing?

HELEN
Her brother was killed ...

HARRY
This  place is ridiculous. there’s a million weak spots up here.

HELEN
I don’t care ...  there’s people up here. why don’t you do something to help somebody?

HARRY
I can’t see a damn thing out  there! there could be fifty million of those things, I can’t see a thing that’s how much good these windows do us ...

HARRY
Wake that girl up.  if there’s going to be a thing on the tube, she might as well know where she stands. i don’t wand anybody’s life on my hands.

HELEN
Harry! ... stop acting like a child!

BEN
I don’t want to hear anymore from  you, mister. if you stay up here, you’ll take your orders from me ...
and that includes leaving that girl alone. she needs rest ... she’s just about out of her head as it is now ...
now  we’re just going to let her sleep it off. and nobody’s going to touch her unless i say so ...

HELEN
It’s on.. it’s on!

HARRY
Play with the rabbit-ears ...  we should be able to get something.

TV COMMENTATOR
... assign little credibility to  the theory that this onslaught is a product of mass hysteria. 
Authorities advise utmost caution  until the menace can be brought under absolute control. 
Eyewitness accounts have been investigated and documented.

TV COMMENTATOR
Corpses of vanquished aggressors  are presently being examined by medical pathologists, but autopsy efforts have been hampered by the mutilated condition of these
corpses. Security measures instituted in metropolitan areas include enforced curfews and safety patrols by armed personnel.
Citizens are urged to remain in their homes. Those who ignore this warning expose themselves to intense danger from the aggressors themselves, and
from armed citizenry ... whose impulse may be to shoot first and ask questions later.

TV COMMENTATOR
Rural or otherwise-isolated  dwellings have most frequently been the objective of frenzied,
concerted attack. isolated families are in extreme danger. Escape attempts should be
made in heavily-armed groups, and  by motor vehicle if possible. appraise your situation carefully before deciding upon an escape
tactic.  Fire is and effective weapon. these beings are highly flammable. Escape groups should
strike out for the nearest urban community. Manned defense outpost have been established on major arteries leading into all
communities. These outposts are equipped to defend refugees and to offer medical and surgical assistance.
Police and vigilante groups are in the process of combing remote areas in search and destroy missions against all aggressors.These patrols are
attempting to evacuate isolated families.

TV COMMENTATOR
But rescue efforts are proceeding  slowly, due to the increased danger of nightfall and the sheer enormity of the task.
rescue, for  those in isolated circumstances, is highly undependable. you should not wait for a rescue party unless there is no possibility of
escape.  If you are few against many, you will almost certainly be overcome.
The aggressors are  irrational and demented. their sole urge is the quest for human flesh.
Sheriff Conan W.  McClelland, of the county department of public protection,was interviewed minutes after he
and his vigilante patrol had  vanquished several of the aggressors. we bring you now the results of that interview.

MCCLELLAND
...  yeah ... well, this is rough country for an evening hike ...
... but things ain’t going too  badly. the men are taking it pretty well. we killed nineteen of ‘em today,
right around this  general area. these last three we found trying to claw their way into an abandoned mine shed ... nobody in there.. but these things
just pounding and clawing, trying  to bust their way in ...

MCCLELLAND
it’s funny in a way ...  must’ve thought there was people in there ... we heard the racket and came and blasted them down ...

REPORTER
What’s your opinion, then? can we defeat these things?

MCCLELLAND
There ain’t no problem.. only  problem is whether we can get to ‘em before they kill off all these people. but me and my men can handle ‘em okay ... 
we ain’t lost nobody, or suffered any casualties. all you gotta do is shoot for the eyes. you can tell anybody out there ...
all you  gotta do is draw a sharp bead and shoot for the eyes ... or beat ‘em down ‘n lop their heads off ... .

REPORTER
Then I’d have a decent chance ... even if I was surrounded by two or three of them?

MCCLELLAND
If you had yourself a club ... or a good torch.. you could hold ‘em off or burn ‘em to death. 
they catch fire like nothin’ ... go up like wax paper ... but the best thing is to shoot for the eyes ...
don’t wait for us to rescue you ... ’cause if they get you too far outnumbered you’ve had it ... We’re doin’ our best.. but we only got so many men and a whole lot of open country to comb ... .

REPORTER
But you think you can bring things under control?

MCCLELLAND
We got things in our favor now. It’s only a question of time. We ain’t for certain how many there are of them things ... .
but we  know that when we find ‘em we’re able to kill ‘em. so it’s a matter of time ... they’re weak ...
but there’s pretty many of ‘em ... don’t wait for no rescue party. arm yourself to the teeth, get together in a group, and try and make it to a rescue station ... that’s the best way ...
but if  you’re alone you got to set stock still and wait for help ... . and we’ll try like hell to get there before they do ...

MCCLELLAND
tell ‘em to shoot for the eyes ... that’ll stop these bojobbers!

COMMENTATOR
You have heard Sheriff Conan W. McClelland, for the county department of public protection. 
this is your civil defense emergency network, with reports  every hour on the hour for the duration of this emergency.
Remain in your homes. Keep all  doors and windows locked. Do not under any circ ...

TOM
Why’d you click it off for?

BEN
The man said they only come on  every hour ... . we heard all we need to know. We gotta get out of here.

HELEN
he said the rescue stations have  doctors and medical supplies ... If we could get there, they could help Karen.

HARRY
How’re we gonna bust outta here?  we got a sick kid, two women ... one of ‘em outta her head and three men. And there’s a million of them things outside.

TOM
Willard should have a checkpoint  there ... about seventeen miles from here.

BEN
You from here ... you know this area?

TOM
Yeah ... I was workin’ in the cemetery across the road ... I’m the caretaker ... two of them things attacked me and i hightailed it over here ... 
found everybody wiped out ...  not too long after, these other people fought their way in here ... I was scared but I opened the basement door and let them in. 

BARBARA
You work in the cemetery? ...  My brother is over there.

HELEN
You poor thing ... 
My boy is hurt too. we have to get to a rescue station ... the television told us ... we have to try and escape. 

HARRY
Well, I think we ought to stick  right here ... and wait for a rescue party. 
He said if you’re few against many you don’t have a chance ... We can’t tramp seventeen miles through those things ... .

BEN
We ain’t got to tramp. My truck’s right outside the door.

BEN
...  But i’m just about out of gas ... There’s a pump near the shed outside, but it’s locked.

TOM
The key ought to be around somewhere ... . there’s a big key- ring in the basement ... .

HARRY
I’m gonna go look ... the keys are labeled

BEN
Is there a fruit-cellar?  

HARRY
Yeah ... why?

BEN
We’re gonna need lots of jars ...  We can make molotov cocktails ... scare those things back ... then fight our way to the pump and gas up the truck.

TOM
We’re gonna need kerosene. There’s a jug of that in the basement too.

HELEN
Barbara and i can help. We can rip up sheets and things.

HARRY 
Here’s the key-ring. The pump key is marked with a piece of tape.

BEN
Good ...  that settles that question ... but we should take a crowbar anyway ...
in case the  key doesn’t work. The crowbar can double as a weapon for whoever goes with me.
But I don’t want to  get all the way out there and find out the pump won’t open ... .

TOM
I’ll go ...  you and me can fight our way to the pump ...
The women can stay in the cellar and take care of the kid. We should have a stretcher ... . bBarbara and Helen can do that ...

BEN
Harry, you’re gonna have to guard  the upstairs.
Once we inboard the door, those things can get in here easy. But me and tom have to get in, too, after we get back here with the truck.
You’ve got to guard the door, and unlock it for us. Then we’ll board it up as fast as we can, ‘cause those things are gonna come fast on our heels ...
If we don’t get back, well then you’ll be able to see from upstairs, and you can barricade the door again and go to the basement ...
You can sit down there and wait for a rescue party.

HARRY
I want the gun, then.  it’s the best thing for me to use. You’re not going to have time to stop and aim. 

BEN
I’m keeping this gun ... nobody else lays a hand on it ... I found it and it’s mine.

HARRY
You don’t care what happens to us ... . How do we know you and Tom won’t just take the truck and cut out?

BEN
That’s the chance you have to take. If we cut out, you’ll have your goddamn basement. Like you’ve been crying about all along.

HELEN
We’re going to die here ... if we don’t all work together. 

BARBARA
My brother’s out there ...  maybe we can get him and bring him back. He’s just wounded ... he’ll be okay ...

HELEN
That’s okay, honey ... . we’ll be all right ... maybe your brother will be, too ...

BEN
Let’s get busy.  we’ve got a lot to do, if we’re gonna bust out of here.

BARBARA
I don’t know what to think about my brother ...
We have to get out  of here ... maybe we’ll find him in Willard ... 
maybe he was able to crawl to the car ...
and get  away ... .

HELEN
We have to think of ourselves now ... it’s hard for you ... but it’s all we can do ... my girl is getting worse too ...
I have to  get her to a doctor ...

HARRY
Broomsticks and belt-buckles ... and old sheets, it seems to hold okay ... I always hated the boy scouts ...
TOM

It’ll be okay ... is there anything open upstairs?

HARRY
Some windows in the rooms.  ben is unfastening the doors now.

TOM
We’ll throw the cocktails from upstairs ... just splash the whole area with them ... That should keep most of them away ... while we make a break for the truck.

HELEN
We’re ready ... here comes Ben now ...

BEN
Things are ready up there.  Now me and tom will un-board the front door ...
Harry, you take the two  women upstairs. Carry the molotov cocktails with you ... Soon as the door’s unbarred, we can throw those things all over the place ...
Make sure they catch  fire good ... then the women bust down here and get in the cellar. don’t forget the stretcher ... When we hear your footsteps on the
stairs, me and tom’ll be gone.  It’ll be up to you, Harry ... you’ve gotta watch this door ... Got yourself a good length of pipe?

HARRY
I have a pitchfork.

BEN
Good ... okay.

HARRY
That’s all, Ben ... run for it!

BEN
You ... rotten ... next.. time ... you try something ... like that.. I’ll kill you ... 

BEN
Come on up! it’s us ... it's all  over ... Tom is dead!

BEN
Ten minutes to three ...  there’ll be another broadcast in ten minutes ... .

BEN
Don’t ... don’t anyone of you look out there... You won’t like what you see ...

BARBARA
We’ll never get out of here ...  none of us! ...
we’ll never get out of her alive! Johneee! Johneee! ... oh! ... oh! ...
god ... none of us ... none of us ... help ... oh god ... god!

HELEN 
I’m going to the cellar to take care of Karen.

Come on honey ... come and talk to me ... it’ll make you feel better ... .

HARRY
I’ve got to get that gun ... we can go to the cellar ... You have to help me ... .

HELEN
I’m not going to help you ... .  haven’t you had enough ... he’d kill us both.

HELEN
Karen ...

BEN
Harry!  Harry! ... . give me a hand over here!

BEN
What are you up to man? We’ve got to keep those things out!

HARRY
Now we’ll see who’s going to shoot who ... I’m going to the cellar ... and you can rot up here ... you crazy bastard ...

MCCLELLAND
Come on ... let’s step lively now ... never can tell what we’ll run into up here ... .

MCCLELLAND
You keeping in touch with the squad-cars, George?

GEORGE Yeah ... they know where we are. They should be intercepting us at the house ...

MCCLELLAND
Good ... these men is dog- tired ... they can use some rest and hot coffee ... 
Let’s push along, now ... the squad cars’ll be waiting with coffee and sandwiches at the house ...

MCCLELLAND
Looks like this guy’s car ...  poor fellow ... never had a chance ... .

PATROLMAN
Hi, Connie ... how’s things goin’?

MCCLELLAND
Sure glad to see you fellas,  Charlie ...
we been at it all  night ... but I don’t want to break ‘til we get to the house over there ...
We might be  lollygaggin’ around whole somebody needs our help. we’ll see first,  then stop and get some coffee ......

PATROLMAN
Anything you say,  Connie ... ... .

BEN
Barbara ...  Barb ... here, honey ... there’s men outside ...  I can hear them ... they must be here to rescue us ...

MCCLELLAND
Shoot for the eyes boys ...  like I told you before ... always aim right for the eyes ... ... ..

MCCLELLAND
Damn it, what’d you shoot for?  I told you to be careful ... there might be people in there ... ..

MAN WHO FIRED THE SHOT
Naw, this place is demolished,  there ain’t nobody in there ... ..

PATROLMAN
I’m sure I heard a girl’s scream ...  from the basement, maybe ... .

MCCLELLAND
Anybody down there?

MCCLELLAND
It’s all right men ...  come on down ... it’s just a girl down here!

MCCLELLAND
It’s too bad ... an accident ...  the only loss we had, the whole night.
