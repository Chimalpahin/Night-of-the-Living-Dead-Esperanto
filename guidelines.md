## Translation

Rules to go by with the translation (to be determined...)

### Names

Should we keep totally original names, or "Esperantize" them?
Personally, I think having original English names would break the flow, but that's just me.

My vote is to esperantize the names. I would like this to be seen as "localized" (as much as Esperanto can be), rather than just translated.
