Night-of-the-Living-Dead-Esperanto
==================================

Translation of the public domain movie, "Night of the Living Dead", into Esperanto (Script, other files)

Script is available at: http://wdjoyner.org/zombies/romero-etal_night-of-the-living-dead_script-1968.pdf



## About Project

This tentative project is an effort to translate, as well as re-dub, the original
Night of the Living Dead movie.

This will include redubbing character lines to be in Esperanto,
as well as perhaps finding new music and sound effects to edit into the movie,
and perhaps overlaying text in the movie with Esperanto (where it can be done cleanly).

## Volunteer Roles

Definitely need some volunteers!

### Translators

Go through the English script and translate to Esperanto, or review existing translations in the script.

### Music, Sound Effect finders (or creators)

We will need music and sound effects that we have the rights to use; we need some people to find these things, or create original sounds and such, for the project.

### Voice Actor Coordinator

Someone to coordinate with voice actors, get their lines, make sure their pronunciation is good and the lines flow decently well (we don't have to be professional voice actors, but I'd like some amount of emotion/smoothness), making sure lines fit the timing of the movie.

### Voice Actors

People who can speak Esperanto well, to read lines for characters in the movie

### Video Editor

Someone to edit together the movie.

(Rachel wants to do this unless someone else really really wants to!)
