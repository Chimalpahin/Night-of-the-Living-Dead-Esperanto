## About Project

This tentative project is an effort to translate, as well as re-dub, the original
Night of the Living Dead movie.

This will include redubbing character lines to be in Esperanto,
as well as perhaps finding new music and sound effects to edit into the movie,
and perhaps overlaying text in the movie with Esperanto (where it can be done cleanly).
